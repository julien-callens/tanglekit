###### PROGRAMMEREN 3: JS-FRAMEWORK
# TangleKit
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tanglekit)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tanglekit)

**A JS framework made in the image of svelte with custom `.tngl` files.**

- It has a vite plugin for ease of use.
- The framework is made so it outputs formatted html which can be easily added to the dom.
- Imports are handled efficiently to reduce re-parsing of files by the compiler.
- `.tngl` files output a single Function which returns html and accepts props (if defined in the file).

For more info check out the README's of the respective projects.
